 * A style may be used to decide which set of rules to use for the project or module, for example using Checkstyle.
 * 
 * A style may be actually used to declare a default design decision, for example the style "FunctionalFirst" 
 * would assume that every class is an Immutable Value Object and that every method only accepts NotNull parameters and never returns null, 
 * unless declared expressly.
