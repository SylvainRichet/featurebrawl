 * 
 * This properties are assumed to be verifiable in an automated fashion, e.g. through an automated unit test.
 * 
 * Tools can rely on these declared properties to perform optimizations, e.g. a Map-Reduce implementation 
 * could rely on the declared associativity to optimize its reduce step.
